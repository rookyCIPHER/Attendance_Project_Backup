# Student Record Management System 

Under the guidance of esteemed institute professor Dr. Sharad Sinha, our team of four students at IIT Goa developed this project. Our project was designed with the primary objective of developing an efficient student record management system. This system aimed to alleviate the burden on teachers by automating the process of tracking student attendance. Furthermore, we integrated modern technologies, specifically artificial intelligence, to mitigate instances of proxy attendance, ensuring a more accurate and reliable record-keeping process.

## Tech-Stack
Our web app consisted of three components, mainly the front end, the back end, and our database. After careful consideration keeping in mind the efficient working of the end-product and taking complete advantage of the capabilities of the team members. The following tech-stack structure was used. 

- **Frontend Development**: ReactJS was employed to create the frontend, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend Development**: The project's backend functionalities were developed using Django Rest Framework, providing robustness and flexibility in handling data and requests.
- **Database Management**: MySQL served as the chosen database for storing project-related data, offering reliability and scalability for data management.
- **Face Recognition Model**: Initially, our team constructed a Face Recognition model utilizing Python (which was later scraped due to hardware constraints). The implementation involved leveraging sophisticated libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

## What's so special about us?

While offering a reliable attendance system and enhancing traditional student record management with modern technologies, we've incorporated additional functionalities to elevate user experience and simplify record maintenance for teachers:-

- Our two-pronged security system utilizes technologies like face recognition and geolocation to prevent proxy attendance marking.
- Given the fluctuating bandwidth of the WiFi networks, addressing technical glitches is crucial. As a result, we've granted special privileges to teachers to manually edit the attendance list.
- To prevent data redundancy and unintended record manipulation, we've incorporated special alerts to deter any illicit actions that could result in data tampering.
